# CLICalculator
Text-based calculator written in Java which can evaluate complex arithmetic expressions.

This program supports five different operators, in order of precedence:
  ^ (exponent)
  * (multiply)
  / (divide)
  + (add)
  - (subtract)
Negative and decimal numbers are supported.

There is also support for functions with the syntax func_name(expression).
The default functions are:
  sqrt() (square root)
  log_10() (log base 10)
  logn() (natural log)
  sin() (sine)
  cos() (cosine)
  tan() (tangent)
  
 Stand-alone parentheses or those part of functions are evaluated first.
 Ex. (3 + 4) * 2 + sqrt(4 + 5) returns 17.0
 
 Implementing new functions or binary operators can be done without deeply analyzing the code.
